## Conclusion
Jira gives me excellent control over my tasks and stories. When a story needs to be split into different tasks, it provides the necessary tools
and management features.

Documenting in Confluence allows me to review my past work and helps with future tasks. It's crucial to link everything here and add as
much information as possible for anyone to reference. This includes technical issues, troubleshooting, know-how, and workshops.

Cypress is an outstanding tool for creating End-to-End Automated Tests. It uses the target web application and verifies with its auto-reload
feature every time I save the code.

### There is always room for improvement
Revisiting and refactoring the `do_job_application.cy.js` could be a nice idea. I have used a lot of `wait` function calls to pure purpose of
demonstration.
